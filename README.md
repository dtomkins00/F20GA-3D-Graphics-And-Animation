# F20GA Coursework Project

# Theme
The theme of this 3D diorama is a slightly fantasy themed residence, with the buildings looking more medieval or primitive as a result of this alongside no modern technology being present, however a few magical elements can be found around the project (mainly in the form of lights) - particularly the animation video - to give off this impression.

The theme was mainly inspired by the TV series "Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina", particularly the third episode which had a small village that had a nice aesthetic to it, so I took some inspiration from that to develop the theme for this project and put my own spin on it with some extra additions such as a pond and rocks in the diorama. to make it more my own thing so the theme would be more interesting to work with.

Later on in the modelling process I decided to give some more offputting or ominous vibes to the theme by adding things such as a grave and I made the witch look otherworldly to an extent by making her a shadow human. This extended to the animation when I ended it off with having another witch rise out of the grave as the animation faded to black.
